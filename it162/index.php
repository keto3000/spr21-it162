      <p>I love meeting new people and discovering new places!  I've backpacked most of the United States, all of Canada and Puerto Rico.</p>
      <p>As a lifelong student of anthropology & archaeology, patterns of culture and human ecology are my passion.</p>
      <p>A few key travel priorites still on my bucket list include treks to visit Olduvai Gorge & the Serengeti plains of East Africa; Turkey's ancient archeological sites including Gobekli Tepe (the world oldest temple) and a touring trip of medieval historical sights in Prague and Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p>My 20+ years working in the hospitality/event management industry in 3 major US cities has allowed me to work with a broad spectrum of people and global cultures. I'm currently pursuing a career in web development & design while honing my skills in creative content writing.</p>
      <p>An ideal career environment for me would combine my love of travel with my passion to write and work on creative web design & development projects in the fields of hospitality, cultural events, museums and archaeological tourism.</p>
